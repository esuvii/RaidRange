# RaidRange

Tracks nearby raid members. Supported range values are 5, 10, 15, 20 yds.


## Setup

Drag the generated character specific macro onto your bars, and click it when you are happy with the position. For the addon to function it will require the use of this action bar slot. At present, the addon requires "Raid-Style Party Frames" to function in parties.


## Usage

Toggle the range finder using ``/rr`` or ``/raidrange``.

You can type ``/rr help`` for a list of other commands, i.e. for adjusting settings or the range value being tracked.
